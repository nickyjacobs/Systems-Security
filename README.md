# Systems Security (SYS) – Final Project ⭐

## Objective
[To be completed]

This final project is part of the Systems Security (SYS) course within the Ethical Hacking program.  
The objective of this project is to design, implement, and document a realistic but accessible Security Challenge in the form of an Easy-level Hack-the-Box–style virtual machine.

In addition to creating the Security Challenge, this project also focuses on demonstrating the ability to analyze, exploit, and report on security challenges developed by peers, following professional security assessment methodologies.

## Core Assignment Requirements

Key elements of the assignment include:

- Designing and building an original Hack-the-Box–style Security Challenge
- Creating an Easy-level challenge that is challenging yet achievable
- Including multiple technical components, such as:
  - An infrastructure-related component
  - Exploitation of at least one known CVE
  - Pivoting techniques
  - Privilege escalation
- Producing clear and complete design documentation
- Recording a full walkthrough video demonstrating the exploitation path from foothold to root
- Explaining how players are expected to identify vulnerabilities and which techniques are required
- Writing two complete security write-ups for Security Challenges created by other students
